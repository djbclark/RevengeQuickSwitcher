## What this project does

**RevengeQuickSwitcher** (display name: **Quick Server Switcher**) is a Revenge Discord mobile plugin for fast server navigation:

- `/servers` opens a **top-docked searchable switcher** (keyboard-safe); tap a row to jump
- Fuzzy search, aliases, excludes, recent-jump slots (`/servers recent`, `/servers rN`)
- Optional **flat sidebar** (alphabetical, folder-free)
- Bot-message list remains a **fallback** when sheet/alert APIs are missing
- Jump path: dismiss overlay → `openUrl("https://discord.com/channels/{guild}/{channel}")` (JumpTo / Stealmoji pattern)

Install URL (raw base — not the GitHub HTML page):

```

```

Smoke plugin (load isolation):

## 🚦 Cold-start — current state (read this first)

**As of 2026-07-11 (evening).** Released on `main`: **v4.5.9**. **Active QA device:** **s24** (Galaxy S24, USB `RFCX219CHKA`). **QSS plugin:** operator installed on s24 from raw URL (2026-07-10). p7a artifacts archived under `artifacts/qss-qa/p7a-final-archive/` — do not use p7a unless operator asks.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Package / manifest version | `4.5.9` |
| Display name | Quick Server Switcher |
| Bundle | Vendetta IIFE, ES2015 target, `__QSS_VERSION__` injected |
| Unit tests | **96** Vitest tests (`make verify`) |
| Open human gate | **A1** — device QA on Revenge Android (s24) |
| D1 harness | `scripts/device_qa_qss.py` + `make qa` — **uncommitted changes** on `main` |
| Latest s24 QA | Partial — `audit_host` starts, reaches `leave_voice_channel`, then hangs (voice overlay) |

**Working navigation (device-proven):**

1. Open switcher via `/servers` or settings **Open switcher**
2. Host is **top-docked** `openAlert` panel (not bottom ActionSheet — keyboard covers bottom sheets)
3. On pick / Close: `dismissThenRun` / `hideSwitcherSheet` fully tears down the host
4. Then `openUrl` deep link to last/default channel in that guild
5. Do **not** call loose `selectChannel`, Flux `CHANNEL_SELECT` / `GUILD_SELECT`, or `selectGuild` for the jump — those froze or failed to stick on device

**Recent landings (v4.5.x freeze / overlay saga):**

| Ver | What landed | Device outcome |
|-----|-------------|----------------|
| 4.5.4 | Drop loose `selectChannel`; Flux CHANNEL/GUILD_SELECT | Still froze |
| 4.5.5 | Prefer `selectGuild`; version-stamp debug lines | CHANNEL_SELECT verified then freeze; selectGuild didn't stick |
| 4.5.6 | JumpTo-style `openUrl` only | Jump worked; taps dead after |
| 4.5.7 | Harder dismiss before `openUrl` | Still dead taps (leftover overlay) |
| 4.5.8 | Native `ActionSheet` + `hideActionSheet` then `openUrl` | Jump + taps OK; keyboard covered bottom sheet |
| 4.5.9 | Restore **top-docked** panel; keep dismiss-then-`openUrl`; no full-screen scrim; Filter not auto-focused | Keyboard-safe; taps OK |

**Known device facts:**

- `SortedGuildStore not found` → flat sidebar patch is skipped (lower priority; not a start failure)
- Debug ring persists across restarts; every line stamped `[vX.Y.Z …]`; ring clears on version upgrade
- Settings → **Copy debug logs** pastes a single `|`-separated line (Discord mobile clipboard drops newlines)
- Cloud agents **cannot** reach the phone over ADB; device QA is operator-side (**A1**)

**Next work:** [OPTIONS.md](OPTIONS.md) — **open work only**. Primary gate: **A1** full pass on s24 with QSS installed. Harness: **D1** (`device_qa_qss.py` + stayturgid/Handsets). **Do not** run ad-hoc `python -c` probes that type into composers — use `make qa` only (see Safety below).

## Device QA handoff (s24, 2026-07-11)

### What passed

| Step | Status |
|------|--------|
| `make verify` / CI | Green (96 tests) |
| Revenge package `app.revenge` on s24 | OK |
| Cloud VLM (Anthropic Haiku 4.5 / Gemini 3.5 Flash) | OK — `QSS_VLM_CLOUD=anthropic,google` |
| Tesseract OCR gate (`scripts/ocr_gate.py`) | OK — fast pre-check before VLM |
| ADB wireless connect (TLS) | OK — serial `adb-RFCX219CHKA-W06wB0._adb-tls-connect._tcp` |
| ScreenControlSession lease (force-steal) | OK — `STAYTURGID_SCREEN_LEASE_FORCE=1` |
| Nav to test guild **dcs** → `#dc-general` | Usually OK (VLM `safe_test_channel` passes) |
| **QSS plugin installed** | Operator confirmed + installed from raw URL |
| `wait_discord_ready` with voice channel | Fixed — now accepts `Show Chat`/`Disconnect`/`Voice Connected` markers |
| `shot()` screenshot validation | Fixed — validates PNG header + retries up to 3x |

### What failed / flaky (last runs)

| Issue | Cause | Harness note |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| **`leave_voice_channel` hang** | Device in Stream Room voice overlay; `hs.tap_text("Show Chat")` / `hs.tap_desc("Disconnect")` time out because Handsets can't find targets in the full-screen voice UI | Need to debug Handsets dump during voice overlay, or add a raw `adb input tap` fallback path for known voice-UI coordinates |
| `safe_guild_nav_failed` (intermittent) | Sidebar guild tap: **coord tap** on icon column does not select guild; **`tap_text("Danny Clark's server")` works** | `tap_sidebar_guild()` already prefers `tap_text` — verify on next run |
| Emoji keyboard obstruction | Prior coord taps hit emoji toggle | `dismiss_emoji_keyboard()` added before profile |
| Accidental chat/DM text | `handsets type/fill` with `QSS_VLM=0` on DM threads; slash `fill "/"` + `tap_text "/ servers"` → `//servers` | **Fixed** — see Safety |

Artifacts: `~/.local/share/RevengeQuickSwitcher/artifacts/qss-qa/2026-07-11/s24/`

### Safety policy (mandatory for agents)

**Priority #1:** never send chat/DM text to real users or non-test channels. Speed does not matter.

| Control | Env / code |
|---------|------------|
| Safe mode (default on) | `QSS_SAFE_MODE=1` — all typing requires VLM `before_type` + surface check |
| Post-type verify | Screenshot + VLM `after_type` after every `fill`/`type` |
| DM block | `ui_dm_thread()` — abort if composer shows `Message @user` |
| Allowlisted typing only | Switcher **Filter servers**, plugin install URL, safe `#channel` slash (only if `QSS_ALLOW_SLASH=1`) |
| Default switcher path | Settings → Plugins → **Open switcher** (slash disabled by default) |
| No debug probes | Do **not** run one-off scripts that `type`/`fill`/tap composers on live account |

Full runbook: [VLM.md](VLM.md) (Safety-first automation section).

### Incidents (learn from these)

1. **Stray `,` DM to kuriboh** — device on DM thread; coord/wordle probes typed into composer with VLM off.
2. **`//servers` in channel** — slash path typed `/` then `tap_text("/ servers")` doubled the slash; old path could tap Send.

### D1 harness changes (2026-07-11 session)

All changes are **uncommitted** in working tree:

| Change | Files |
|--------|-------|
| OCR gate integration (Tesseract pre-check) | `scripts/device_qa_qss.py`, `scripts/ocr_gate.py` (new) |
| Cloud VLM primary (Anthropic/Gemini), local fallback | `scripts/device_qa_qss.py`, `scripts/vlm_cloud.py` (model=gemini-3.5-flash) |
| Screenshot validation (PNG header + retry) | `scripts/device_qa_qss.py` `shot()` |
| Voice channel markers in `wait_discord_ready` | `scripts/device_qa_qss.py` |
| Voice channel markers in `ui_looks_like_discord` | `scripts/device_qa_qss.py` |
| Screen lease force-steal on entry | `scripts/device_qa_qss.py` `audit_host()` |
| Scroll direction fix (`hs.swipe("up")` to scroll down) | `scripts/device_qa_qss.py` `scroll_settings_toward_top()` |
| Element bounds validation (`_on_screen()`) | `scripts/device_qa_qss.py` |
| Plugin settings navigation rework | `scripts/device_qa_qss.py` `tap_plugins_settings()`, `navigate_to_qss_plugin()` |

### Device cleanup (end of session)

After QA, restore s24 without UI automation:

```bash
# Release lease
DEVICE_SCREEN_CONTROL_PROJECT=RevengeQuickSwitcher \
  python3 ~/stayturgid/control/bin/screen_lease.py release s24

# Inversion off + auto-rotate back (adb only — no Handsets)
serial=RFCX219CHKA
adb -s $serial shell settings put secure accessibility_display_inversion_enabled 0
adb -s $serial shell settings put system accelerometer_rotation 1
adb -s $serial shell settings put global window_animation_scale 1
adb -s $serial shell settings put global transition_animation_scale 1
adb -s $serial shell settings put global animator_duration_scale 1
```

Use `restore_screen=False` during QA so session exit does not land on Termux/other prior app.

### Commands for next agent

```bash
# Verify plugin builds
make verify

# Full QA run (will hit leave_voice_channel hang)
QSS_VLM=1 QSS_SAFE_MODE=1 \
  make qa QSS_DEVICE=s24 QSS_GUILD=dcs

# Debug leave_voice_channel — step-by-step
cd ~/src/RevengeQuickSwitcher
PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 python3 -c "
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'scripts')
import device_qa_qss as dq
# ... replicate audit_host up to ScreenControlSession,
# then manually inspect hs.ui() to see what Handsets sees
"
```

**Uncommitted harness work (2026-07-11):** `scripts/device_qa_qss.py`, `scripts/ocr_gate.py` (new), `scripts/vlm_cloud.py`, `OPTIONS.md` — not committed; operator has not requested commit.

---

**Verify / ship:**

```bash
make install   # once
make verify    # typecheck + 96 tests + build + manifest hash
```

After source edits: commit updated `dist/index.js` + `manifest.json` `hash` (verify rewrites hash). Bump `package.json` + `manifest.json` `version` together; update `CHANGELOG.md`.

---

## Agent conventions

### Cursor rules (`.cursor/rules/`)

This repo ships **Cursor project rules** under [`.cursor/rules/`](.cursor/rules/) — `.mdc` files with YAML frontmatter that Cursor injects into agent sessions (some `alwaysApply: true`, others scoped by glob).

**On handoff, read these before improvising:**

| Rule file | Scope | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| [`vlm-docs.mdc`](.cursor/rules/vlm-docs.mdc) | always | After QA/VLM discoveries, update [`VLM.md`](VLM.md) in the same session |

Add new rules here when standing conventions emerge (device QA, commit style, doc maintenance). Rules complement this file and [`VLM.md`](VLM.md); they are not a substitute for reading HANDOFF cold-start state.

### Device preference (when operator has stayturgid fleet)

Same order as stayturgid when a phone must be used and the choice does not matter:

1. **s24** (Galaxy S24) — preferred
2. **hd8** (Kindle Fire HD 8) — second
3. **p7a** (Pixel 7a) — third (daily driver; avoid unless needed)

Announce before live UI work when someone may be on the device:

`🚨📱🚨 USING — s24 — Revenge QA — ~N min`

When done: `✅📱✅ FREE — s24 ✅📱✅`

Mac→Android UI automation lives in **stayturgid** (`control/lib/ui_driver.py`, `control/bin/gui_audit.py`). This plugin ships **`scripts/device_qa_qss.py`** + `make qa` (**D1** Phase 1). Prefer Vitest here; device QA uses Handsets + ScreenControlSession, not Appium-first.

**Cloud vs Desktop:** cloud agents cannot reach the phone over ADB. Run **D1** from **Cursor Desktop on the Mac** with stayturgid + Handsets + ADB.

### Cloud / Desktop resume

This project's cloud-agent runs are under the same Cursor account as stayturgid work. Example resume URL for the docs/nav saga context:

```
https://cursor.com/agents/bc-0b0c3481-2bce-460e-a05e-55297c36db57
```

Repo: `https://github.com/djbclark/RevengeQuickSwitcher` (GitHub may also show `revengequickswitcher` casing). Default base branch: **`main`**. Feature branches for cloud agents: `cursor/<descriptive-name>-db57`.

### Do / don't

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Keep bot-message fallback when sheet APIs missing | Call loose Metro `selectChannel` / Flux select for jumps |
| Dismiss switcher host **before** `openUrl` | Leave full-screen scrims / nested RN `Modal` hosts |
| Target ES2015 IIFE; avoid `??=` / optional-chain in output | Eval-time `storage` / top-level `this` (breaks enable) |
| Stamp debug lines with plugin version | Mix multi-version debug pastes without clearing ring |
| Update OPTIONS status + CHANGELOG in the same PR as behavior | Renumber shipped option IDs |

---

## How updates work

GitHub `main` is the source of truth. Revenge loads `manifest.json` + `main` (`dist/index.js`) from the raw URL.

1. Edit `src/`, bump version in `package.json` + `manifest.json` when shipping behavior.
2. `make verify` (rebuilds `dist/`, refreshes `hash`).
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` + OPTIONS statuses.
4. Commit, push, open PR → merge to `main`.
5. On device: plugin info → **Refetch**, or delete + reinstall raw URL; force-quit Discord.

Semver policy: top of [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Architecture notes (durable)

### Navigation

`navigateToGuild` in `src/index.tsx`:

- Resolve a channel id (last selected / default / first selectable)
- Require `findByProps("openUrl")` (or `openURL` casing)
- `openUrl("https://discord.com/channels/{guildId}/{channelId}")`
- Treat as fire-and-forget; SelectedGuildStore may update async

Prior art: **aliernfrog/JumpTo**, **Stealmoji** (`hideActionSheet` before side effects).

### Switcher UI

`src/sheets.tsx`:

- Prefer top-docked `openAlert` host (`SwitcherTopPanel`) so Android keyboard does not cover the list
- Bottom native `ActionSheet` worked for taps (4.5.8) but failed keyboard UX → reverted for primary path in 4.5.9
- `dismissThenRun`: hide/dismiss first, then run `onPick` → `openUrl`
- Simple action sheet + bot messages as degraded paths

### Slash command

Revenge inverted `shouldHide` historically hid `/servers` — omit that flag and fill command metadata (see CHANGELOG 4.4.5). Replies use `sendBotMessage` when falling back to in-channel lists. Unregister-before-register avoids duplicates.

### Bundle shape

Revenge evals roughly: `vendetta => { return <plugin.js> }` then `ret?.default ?? ret`. Build wraps CJS in `(function(exports){ ...; return exports })({})`. Hermes rejects some modern syntax → **ES2015** target.

### Vision gates (D1 harness)

The harness has a 3-tier vision system:

1. **OCR gate** (Tesseract) — free, fast, runs on every screenshot before VLM. Matches keyword patterns. Returns True/False/Inconclusive.
2. **Cloud VLM** (Anthropic Haiku 4.5 first, Gemini 3.5 Flash fallback) — paid, slower, runs when OCR is inconclusive. API keys in `~/.config/RevengeQuickSwitcher/secrets.env`.
3. **Local UI-TARS** — last resort fallback if cloud is unconfigured.

Set `QSS_VLM_CLOUD=anthropic,google` for primary cloud path. Set `QSS_VLM=0` to disable all vision gates and trust Handsets a11y tree only.

---

## Known issues / gotchas

- **Paste GitHub HTML URL** → "Failed to fetch manifest". Must use `raw.githubusercontent.com/.../main/`.
- **Safe Mode** → plugins do not start.
- **X on toggle** → start failed; try smoke plugin; check Copy debug logs / logcat.
- **Dead taps after jump** → almost always leftover overlay host, not failed `openUrl`. Dismiss harder; avoid full-screen custom scrims.
- **Keyboard covers list** → do not use bottom ActionSheet as the primary switcher host on Android.
- **Flat sidebar silent skip** → SortedGuildStore missing on some builds; log and continue.
- **Clipboard newlines** → Copy debug logs is one line on purpose.
- **Cloud VM has no phone** — never claim device QA passed from CI alone.
- **`leave_voice_channel` hang** — Handsets `tap_text`/`tap_desc` time out in full-screen voice overlay. Device left in "Stream Room" voice channel. Need raw ADB tap fallback or better voice-UI detection.
- **TLS-ADB serial changes** — serial `adb-RFCX219CHKA-W06wB0._adb-tls-connect._tcp` sometimes gets a ` (2)` suffix after reconnect; harness resolves via `resolve_device_serial()` which handles this.
- **SSH hostname case** — SSH lowercases `adb-RFCX219CHKA...` hostnames; ScreenControlSession uses the short host `"s24"` (which resolves to IP) not the TLS-ADB serial directly.
- **ADB exec-out screencap can return corrupt data** — `shot()` now validates PNG header bytes and retries up to 3x.

## Appendix — Strategic directions

| Track | Summary | Best when… |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **A — Device QA** | Close **A1** on v4.5.9; capture Copy debug logs | Operator has Revenge phone |
| **B — Switcher polish** | Pins (**C4**), paging UX, settings entry points | A1 green; sheet path stable |
| **C — High-risk Metro** | Channel jump (**C2**), folder-aware sort (**C3**) | Explicit ask; expect client churn |
| **D — Harness** | Unattended `device_qa_qss.py` + Handsets (**D1** Phases 0–3) | Repeatable device regression; Desktop Mac + ADB |
| **E — Docs only** | Keep HANDOFF/OPTIONS/TESTING current | After every behavior PR |

**Rejected / avoid:** faux DM or fake server as switcher UI (**C8**); Flux/`selectChannel` jump paths; full-screen touch-blocking scrims; Appium-first automation for this small plugin.
